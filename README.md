# StrucEng_Library

 `StrucEng Library` is an add-on package for the open-source, python-based computational framework COMPAS FEA. The `StrucEng Library` includes mechanical models, saftey concepts, GUI's, load generator, etc. for the strucutral analysis of reinforced concrete and masonry members:

### Models for reinforced concrete
* Sandwichmodel: linear-elastic ideal-plastic analysis of reinforced concrete shell structures 
* CMM-Usermat: ...in progress...
* Cross-section analysis: ...in progress...

### Models for masonry
* URM-Usermat: ...in progress...

### safty concepts
* Partial Safty Factors (PSF): ...in progress...
* Estimate of coefficient of variation: ...in progress...
* Full probabilistic analysis: ...in progress...

### Load generators
* Traffic loads on bridges
* more in progress...

### Installation and Examples
Please check out our [Wiki] for the installation of  the `StrucEng Library`of the the following [Link](https://github.com/kfmResearch-NumericsTeam/StrucEng_Library/blob/main/Sandwichmodel/Example/Tutorial.pdf) for the installation and the use of the StrucEng Library. A more detailed Wiki will follow soon ...
