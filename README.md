# StrucEng_Library

`StrucEng Library` is an add-on package for the open-source, python-based computational framework COMPAS FEA. The `StrucEng Library` includes mechanical models, saftey concepts, GUI's, load generator, etc. for the strucutral analysis reinforced concrete and masonry:

### Models for reinforced concrete
* Sandwichmodel
* CMM-Usermat
* Cross-section analysis
* ...

### Models for masonry
* URM-Usermat
* ...

### Safty concepts
* Partial Safty Factors (PSF)
* Estimate of coefficient of variation (ECOV)
* Full probabilistic analysis
* ...

### Load generators
* Traffic loads on bridges
* ...
